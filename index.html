        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Adrian Romero. I am from Southern California. I grew up in LA county, in a small town called Monrovia. I lived there for about 17 years until we moved out to Fontana California. I am 18 years old, so have not been living over here for that long. I really like hiking and playing videogames. My parents are from Zacatecas, Mexico. Over there, there is not really any hiking trails like over here in the United states of America. That is what probably made them start liking to hike a lot and what made their 4 kids like hiking too. I think also because the part of Monrovia where we used to live, the mountains were close enough for us to litertally leave our house and start walking up a mountain. Hiking allows you to reconnect with nature, which feels good for some reason. I also like it because it not only lets you feel good, but you can stay in shape by just exploring new trails. My older brother put me on to video games, because he had a play station 2 and he let my twin brother and I play. I also think I liked playing video games from very early on, was because of our neighbors who had every single gaming console. They always invited us over to play video games with them to see who was the best and it just stuck with me. I still play because it allows me to let out my competitive and creative side. It also allows me to play with friends I have in real life. It makes a great place to build stronger bonds between friends. <br><br>

        I want to at least get my bachelors in Computer Science because I believe that it is the best fit for me. Every time I took a computer science class, I ended up really enjoying it and finding it very intresting. I find it very intresting because I like how it makes you really think critically and makes you more creative by letting you create programs just for fun. I really do believe that it is important to know the fundamentals of computer science because computers have taken over the world in a lot of areas and industries. It has been exponentially growing and continuosly growing, so that just shows how important it is to know what is going on around you tech wise.<br><br>

        I took a robotics class in 6th grade and I really liked it because I never understood how people we able to make robots move around and do things. It really did open my eyes to the world of coding because we used websites like code.org tht was very helpful in understanding important concepts. In high school I took another computer science class that was more geared to creating apps, so that was very helpful as well because our teacher made us draw out our app UI and GUI on paper before going onto code.org to convert that paper prototype into the real thing. It also helped me understand knew things I never heard about like machine learning, which he helped us use to sort things and create a basic AI.
